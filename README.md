# Random Projects

A few sample projects I have done in the past from concept to delivery.

## Backend System

I don’t just draw diagrams — I build it end to end, implementing every service from the ground up.

The diagram below illustrates a complex backend system I delivered for a large-scale mobile and web applications. It features a hybrid cloud architecture on DOKS, designed for global high availability and low latency while keeping costs down. The solution uses a microservices approach with GraphQL federation, an event-driven architecture, full observability, and a CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions.
(Some details are blurred for confidentiality.)
